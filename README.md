# Large-scale-Bayesian-Neural-Networks-on-Hybrid-CMOS-ReRAM-Architecture-for-Energy-efficient-and-Rob
This work presents an algorithm-hardware co- simulation approach to implement Bayesian inference with large- scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on hardware in  a highly resource-efficient manner. We replace the end layers of the CNN, including the output softmax, with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). We train this hybrid CNN+BNN model on software and deploy it on a hybrid CMOS-ReRAM based hardware architecture in an area and energy-efficient manner.  Our approach introduces a novel way for deep learning algo- rithms to efficiently take advantage of Bayesian inference without  the overhead of training a convolutional Bayesian model end- to-end as well as hardware complexity. We carry out analyses  on VGG19 and ResNet18 networks using CIFAR10/CIFAR100 datasets and obtain > 3Ã— energy-efficiency by deploying a hybrid VGG19+BNN architecture on hybrid CMOS-ReRAM hardware than a full-scale VGG19 BNN assumed to be implemented on a fully ReRAM-based hardware platform. Furthermore, we also find that our proposed hybrid Bayesian architecture is robust against adversarial and noisy inputs, i.e. it has the ability to identify such inputs and refuses to classify them.
